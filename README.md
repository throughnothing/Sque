# NAME

Sque - Background job processing based on Resque, using Stomp

# VERSION

version 0.008

# SYNOPSIS

First you create a Sque instance where you configure the [Stomp](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Stomp)
backend and then you can start sending jobs to be done by workers:

    use Sque;

    my $s = Sque->new( stomp => '127.0.0.1:61613' );
    # Or, for failover
    $s = Sque->new( stomp => [ '127.0.0.1:61613', '127.0.0.2:61613' ] );

    $s->push( my_queue => {
        class => 'My::Task',
        args => [ 'Hello world!' ]
    });

You can also send by just using:

    $s->push({
        class => 'My::Task',
        args => [ 'Hello world!' ]
    });

In this case, the queue will be set automatically automatically to the
job class name with colons removed, which in this
case would be 'MyTask'.

You can set custom `STOMP` headers by passing them in as follows:

    $s->push( my_queue => {
        class => 'My::Task',
        args => [ 'Hello world!' ],
        headers => { header1 => 'val1', header2 => 'val2' }
    });

Additionally, the [sque](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?sque) command-line tool can be used to send messages:

    $ sque send -h 127.0.0.1 -p 61613 -c My::Task 'Hello world!'

Background jobs can be any perl module that implement a perform() function.
The [Sque::Job](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Sque::Job) object is passed as the only argument to this function:

    package My::Task;
    use strict;
    use 5.10.0;

    sub perform {
        my ( $job ) = @_;
        say $job->args->[0];
    }

    1;

Background jobs can also be OO.  The perform function will still be called
with the [Sque::Job](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Sque::Job) object as the only argument:

    package My::Task;
    use strict;
    use 5.10.0;
    use Moose;

    with 'Role::Awesome';

    has attr => ( is => 'ro', default => 'Where am I?' );

    sub perform {
        my ( $self, $job ) = @_;
        say $self->attr;
        say $job->args->[0];
    }

    1;

Finally, you run your jobs by instancing a [Sque::Worker](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Sque::Worker) and telling it
to listen to one or more queues:

    use Sque;

    my $w = Sque->new( stomp => '127.0.0.1:61613' )->worker;
    $w->add_queues('my_queue');
    $w->work;

Or you can simply use the [sque](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?sque) command-line tool which uses [App::Sque](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::Sque)
like so:

    $ sque work --host 127.0.0.1 --port 61613 --workers 5 --lib ./lib --lib ./lib2 --queues Queue1,Queue2,Queue3

# DESCRIPTION

This is a copy of [resque-perl](https://github.com/diegok/resque-perl)
by [Diego Kuperman](https://github.com/diegok) simplified a little bit
(for better or worse) and made to work with any stomp server rather than Redis.

# ATTRIBUTES

## stomp

A Stomp Client on this sque instance.

## namespace

Namespace for queues, default is 'sque'

## worker

A [Sque::Worker](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Sque::Worker) on this sque instance.

# METHODS

## push

Pushes a job onto a queue. Queue name should be a string and the
item should be a [Sque::Job](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Sque::Job) object or a hashref containing:
class - The String name of the job class to run.
args - Any arrayref of arguments to pass the job.

Example:

    $sque->push( archive => { class => 'Archive', args => [ 35, 'tar' ] } )

## pop

Pops a job off a queue. Queue name should be a string.
Returns a l<Sque::Job> object.

## key

Concatenate `$self-`namespace> with the received array of names
to build a redis key name for this sque instance.

## new\_job

Build a [Sque::Job](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Sque::Job) object on this system for the given
hashref(see [Sque::Job](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Sque::Job)) or string(payload for object).

# ATTRIBUTES

# HELPER METHODS

# TODO

- Make App::Sque that will let you run sque and just pass it the
stomp server/port, queue list, lib directories (if needed), and
number of workers.
- More (real) tests.
