=attr sque

The L<Sque> object running this worker.

=attr queues

Queues this worker should fetch jobs from.

=attr verbose

Set to a true value to make this worker report what's doing while
on work().

=method work

Calling this method will make this worker to start pulling & running jobs
from queues().

This is the main wheel and will run while shutdown() is false.

=method perform

Call perform() on the given Sque::Job capturing and reporting
any exception.

=method reserve

Call reserve() to return the next job popped of the queue(s)

=method add_queues

Add a queue this worker should listen to.

=method log

If verbose() is true, this will print to STDERR.
